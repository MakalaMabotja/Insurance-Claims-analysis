# Insurance Member Data SQL Analysis Project

This project showcases valuable insights extracted from an insurance company's membership data using SQL queries and analysis. Focused on a fictional insurance company based in Australia, the analysis encompasses member details, insurance coverage information, and claims data.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Demonstrate proficiency in SQL syntax and relational database operations, including JOINs, CASE statements, conditional queries, and aggregation functions.
- Understand data analysis requirements and identify relevant data for insights into business operations.
- Conduct a feasibility study of the insurance company's operations to identify areas for improvement and strategic decision-making.

## Project Files

- **Insurance Member data SQL Project.docx**: Provides an overview of the project, including objectives, a glossary of terms, and detailed explanations of SQL queries used for analysis.
- **Insurance Member data SQL Project.sql**: Contains SQL queries for analyzing the insurance company's data covering various aspects such as demographic analysis, occupations, geographic distribution, coverage details, claims history, and profitability assessment.

## Usage

1. Set up a SQL Server instance or use an existing one.
2. Import the provided database into your SQL Server instance.
3. Open the `Insurance Member data SQL Project.sql` file in a SQL editor or query tool.
4. Execute the SQL queries sequentially to extract desired insights.
5. Refer to the `Insurance Member data SQL Project.docx` document for explanations and context behind each query.

## Future Enhancements

This project can be extended further by:

- Integrating SQL analysis with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.
- Performing additional data cleansing and preprocessing steps for handling missing or incorrect data more robustly.
- Exploring advanced SQL techniques such as window functions and recursive queries for more complex analysis scenarios.
- Incorporating machine learning models or predictive analytics to forecast future trends and assess risks more accurately.
